[**Download the app**](https://github.com/encrypt0r/nergiz-quiz/releases/latest)

The server side app is being developed here: [Nergiz Quiz Web](https://github.com/encrypt0r/nergiz-quiz-web) <br>
## Main Features:
+ Chooses a set of questions from a total of 75 questions. And the app makes sure all of the participants get a fair set of questions. Because the questions are devided among 5 levels. So if the user was asked 5 questions, he/she will be asked a question from each level. And if the user was asked 7 questions, he/she will be asked 2 questions for level 1 and 2 and 1 question for level 3, 4 and 5.
+ Ability to change number of questions the app is going to ask (5 to 25)
+ Sends results to a central database, so you can compete with your friends.
+ A lovely UI
+ Tells you your English Skill level (Approximately)
+ Shows your rank among other participants
+ And many others, which I can't remember right now.
